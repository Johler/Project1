<p>One of my jobs is at Starbucks, where ordering a drink sometimes requires multiple decisions to be made. A customer would like  to order a Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino.  I would then ask if they would prefer that creme based or coffee based Frappuccino.  Next, I am to ask if they would like whipped cream on that.  Some customers do not realize it automatically comes with the drink.  Following that we ask every customer for their name so we can call it out for them when their drinks are ready.  The customer has the option to give a real name or a fake name.  Finally, I would ask for the payment which can either be paid with cash or a credit/debit card.   In the end the customer is given their perfect Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino and leave to enjoy. .</p>
<p>The whipped cream was given a number variable so that I could run a number conditional.  I could not find a way to run a number conditional that made any sense.</p>
